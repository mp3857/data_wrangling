```

## 'select'

```{r}
#cool if you only want some columns but not others
select(litters_df, group, litter_number, gd0_weight)
#specify a selection of columns using a colon
select(litters_df, gd0_weight: gd_of_birth)
#specify what you want to lose
select(litters_df, -litter_number)
```

Renaming columns

```{r}
#write what you are renaming it to first
select(litters_df, GROUP = group, LITTer_NUmBer = litter_number)
```

can also rename without using select
```{r}
rename(litters_df, GROUP = group, LITTer_NUmBer = litter_number)
```

select helpers below   ?select_helpers
 selecting things you know you want to keep from litters dataframe everything that starts with
